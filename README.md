# E-Commerce Website using MERN Stack

This repository contains the code for an e-commerce website developed using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. The project was created as part of my undergraduate course in Web-Technologies.

## Technologies Used

- MongoDB: NoSQL database used to store product and user information.
- Express.js: Node.js framework used for building the backend server.
- React.js: JavaScript library used for building the frontend user interface.
- Node.js: JavaScript runtime environment used for the backend server.
- HTML/CSS: Used for designing and styling the website.
- JavaScript: Programming language used for client-side and server-side scripting.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `backend`: Contains the backend server code using Node.js and Express.js.
- `frontend`: Contains the frontend code using React.js.
- `public`: Contains static assets such as images and fonts.
- `src`: Contains the source code for the frontend and backend.

## Getting Started

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Atif-11/your-repository.git`
2. Install dependencies:
   - For backend: `cd backend && npm install`
   - For frontend: `cd frontend && npm install`
3. Start the backend server: `cd backend && npm start`
4. Start the frontend development server: `cd frontend && npm start`
5. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the website.

## Future Improvements

- Implement user authentication and authorization.
- Add payment gateway integration.
- Improve the overall design and user experience.
